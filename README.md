# waynah architecture agency

It's a mission that I had from an association (waynah architecture agency), the subject is architecture and it is represented in the form of posts. The stacks I used to build this site are React, TypeScript and AWS

the steps to follow to launch the site (write in the terminal) :

1 - git clone https://github.com/TheTrikkster/waynah-architecture-agency.git

2 - cd waynah-architecture-agency

3 - npm install

4 - npm start

If you have problem try removing node_modules and package-lock, after write in terminal npm install

Some pages are prohibited for you, access is restricted to administrators only (these pages represent a CRUD).
